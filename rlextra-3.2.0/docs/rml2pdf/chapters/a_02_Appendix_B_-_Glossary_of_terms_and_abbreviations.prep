<b>baseline</b>
</para><para>
In typography, the imaginary line on which characters sit. The
x-height of a font is measured from the baseline to the top of a
lowercase x. The descender, for those characters that have one, is
defined as the portion of the character that falls below the baseline.

<b>Bezier curves</b>
</para><para>
Named after the French mathematician Pierre BÃ©zier, Bezier curves
utilize at least three points to define a curve. The endpoints are
called the anchor points, while any other point is known as a node. The
curves produced by RML's <font face="Courier">&lt;curves&gt;</font>
tag are Bezier curves.

<condPageBreak height="30"/><para style="nospace">
<b>bitmap</b>
</para><para style="nospace">
A bitmap is a way of storing an image. In bitmaps, each pixel
("picture-cell") is stored as one or more bits of data in a "map"
consisting of rows and columns. This means that when you print them
out at the size they were created at they look fine, but shrinking or
enlarging them leads to them looking blocky and ragged.
</para>
<para style="nospace">
JPEG and GIF are both bitmapped graphics formats (as are BMP, PICT and
PNG). You can use gifs and jpegs in your RML document with the
<font face="Courier">&lt;image&gt;</font> tag.

Named after the nineteenth-century mathematician George Boole, Boolean
logic is a form of algebra in which all values are reduced to either
TRUE or FALSE (or 0 and 1).

pigments - such as in printing.

Document Type Definition. A term from XML that refers to the file that defines the
legal building blocks of an XML document, and the permissible ways to structure it.

<b>empty elements</b>
</para><para>
"Empty" elements are those tags that don't have any content, and are closed with
a "<font face="Courier">/&gt;</font>" at the end of the <i>same</i> tag rather
than having a separate closing tag. (e.g. <font face="Courier">&lt;getName id="Header.Title"/&gt;</font>
doesn't have a separate <font face="Courier">&lt;/getName&gt;</font> tag - the
"<font face="Courier">/&gt;</font>" serves to close it so it doesn't need one).
Empty elements are also sometimes known as "singletons".
</para>

<condPageBreak height="30"/><para style="nospace">
<b>fill</b>

In RML, the color that a graphic or text item is filled with (as opposed to that

<b>flowables</b>
</para><para style="nospace">
In RML, "flowables" are items which appear in a story (such as paragraph,
spacer, and tables). Flowables are positioned in sequence running
down a frame until there is no more room left in that frame, when they
are placed in the next frame (or on the next page if necessary). They
can not be mixed with graphics.

In RML, the "image" tag allows you to use existing graphics files in your document. Currently image supports

A lossy compression technique for color images created by the Joint Photographic Experts Group (JPEG).
Better for photos than the GIF format, it can use up to 24-bit color and reduce file sizes to about 5% of their normal size.
JPEG files are widely used on the World Wide Web and many other places.

<b>leading</b>
</para><para style="nospace">
Leading (pronounced "ledding") is the amount of vertical space allotted for a line of type - the
distance between the baseline of one line to the baseline of the next. The name comes from the
way that printers used to use thin strips of lead or brass to separate the lines of metal type.
</para><para style="nospace">
In RML, leading can be supplied as an attribute for the <font face="Courier">para</font> and
<font face="Courier">paraStyle</font> tags.
It is expressed as the height of the line <i>plus</i> the space between lines. So, for example,
using a 12 point font with a leading of 18 gives you a space between lines of 6 points.
</para>
<para>
You can also have negative leading. By giving a number <i>smaller</i> than the size of font you are
using, you can arrange it so that the lines overlap each other.
