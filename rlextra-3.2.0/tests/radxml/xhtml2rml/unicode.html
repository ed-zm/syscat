<p><strong>Higher Maximums</strong> - The maximum contribution level will be raised to &pound;7,200, with up to &pound;3,600 available to invest in Cash ISAs, so you can save even more tax-free. Get the most from your ISA - put in as much as you can afford, as soon as you can.</p>
<p><strong>Greater Flexibility</strong> - The confusion for over 16 million savers between Maxi and Mini ISAs will be removed from April. You now have <strong>ONE</strong> overall allowance, which can be split between Stocks and Shares and Cash in <u>any</u> proportion with a maximum of &pound;3,600 in Cash.</p>
<p><strong>Cash ISAs and TESSAs can be moved</strong> - You will now be able to move some or all of your previous years' Mini Cash ISAs and TESSAs into your Stocks and Shares ISA account. The transfers can be of any size and do not affect this year's allowance. <strong>Remember</strong>, you can NOT transfer back into Cash ISAs afterwards.</p>
<p><strong>Goodbye PEP. ª Hello ISA.</strong> The 3.7million existing PEPs will also be harmonised and incorporated into the ISA system. Any previous General or Single Company PEP will become known as an ISA and may be transferred in the usual manner.</p>
